# assembly-of-robotic-arm-parts-
in this task I made an assembly of mechanical robotic arm by using CINIMA 4D .
this robotic arm is made of many parts which are 5 links and many joints 
first I will talk about links :
1- base : which is hold the rest of other links and fixed them to the ground .
2- arms : rigid bodys that we can connect them together and in this case they allows 180 degree of movement .
3- Waist : it is the link that Located between the base and the arms and connect them togther .
4- Gripper : it is Located at the end of the robotic arm and it is main function to catch or hold .
